### Weekly Raport No.5

During this week I've done following things
 - Added new tests
 - Code refactoring
 - updating implementation and test documents
 - I've written an inefficient version of minimax
 - I gave an P2P review

 ##### ToDo
 I have to make minimax algorithm efficient and implement the bot movements on the board. For a 25 x 25 board
 the original minimax algorithm does not provide good results.
 I've also to write more tests and do some code refactoring
