### Weekly Raport NO. 1

 - During this week I looked for a few interesting topics. I found AI algorithms
interesting and a point of interest in this course. Tic-tac-toe is a two-player,
well-defined and optimal game. I found two important and interesting algorithms
to implement. The first one is MiniMax algorithm and the second one is alpha-beta pruning
which is an enhanced version of MiniMax algorithm.


- Project has been intialized with python poetry and is ready to being implemented.

- This start required me to recap a few important topics from previous studies. For example,
Python poetry and a few documentation related topics has been revisited.
