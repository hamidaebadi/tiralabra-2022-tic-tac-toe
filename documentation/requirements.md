# Introduction
Game has been the fundamental source of AI and it has been an old and well-defined problem in AI since the start
of AI concept. Well-defined, two-person games' algorithms have had huge impact on the development of AI. So, I decided
to impelemt Minimax and alpha-beta pruning algorithm in this course. In this page I lists all requirements for developing 
TIC-TAC-TOE game application. The main goal is to evaluate and document the efficiency of two algorithms used for developing 
this basic two-person, well-defined game. The algorithmes are MiniMax and alpha-beta pruning.

The main component of our game is a tree-state, which is the input of our program. Then the program will analyse it
and produce the best result, which could be the best possible next move in our game.
